title: 'Project Roadmap'

This is a rough idea of what we're going to try:

::::{.columns}
:::{.column}
```{mermaid}
%%| label: project-roadmap
%%| echo: true
---
title: Roadmap

flowchart TD
    data[Sample Data] --> clean(Clean Data)
    clean --> subsample(Subsample Data)
    subsample --> prototype(Prototype Analysis)
    clean --> analyse(Analyse Full Data)
    prototype --> analyse
```
:::
:::{.column}

## Data

See [Data description](data-description.qmd).

## Clean

- Check for NA's.

Linking to figure @project-roadmap doesn't work. This probably
needs a [raw confluence block](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/confluence.html#raw-confluence-blocks).
